    "abstract": "RLScore is a Python open source module for kernel based machine learning. The library provides implementations of several regularized least-squares (RLS) type of learners. RLS methods for regression and classification, ranking, greedy feature selection, multi-task and zero-shot learning, and unsupervised classification are included. Matrix algebra based computational short-cuts are used to ensure efficiency of both training and cross-validation. A simple API and extensive tutorials allow for easy use of RLScore.",
