    "abstract": "We consider the problem of estimating the gradient lines of a density, which can be used to cluster points sampled from that density, for example via the mean-shift algorithm of Fukunaga and Hostetler (1975). We prove general convergence bounds that we then specialize to kernel density estimation.",
