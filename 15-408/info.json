    "abstract": "CVXPY is a domain-specific language for convex optimization embedded in Python. It allows the user to express convex optimization problems in a natural syntax that follows the math, rather than in the restrictive standard form required by solvers. CVXPY makes it easy to combine convex optimization with high-level features of Python such as parallelism and object- oriented design. CVXPY is available at <a href=\"http://www.cvxpy.org/\">www.cvxpy.org</a> under the GPL license, along with documentation and examples.",
