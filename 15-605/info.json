    "abstract": "We introduce a novel scheme for choosing the regularization parameter in high-dimensional linear  regression with Lasso. This scheme, inspired by Lepski\u00e2\u0080\u0099s method for bandwidth selection in non-parametric  regression, is equipped with both optimal finite-sample guarantees and a fast algorithm. In particular, for any design matrix such that the Lasso has low sup-norm error under an \u00e2\u0080\u009coracle choice\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the  regularization parameter, we show that our method matches the oracle performance up to a small constant factor,  and show that it can be implemented by performing simple tests along a single Lasso path. By applying the  Lasso to simulated and real data, we find that our novel scheme can be faster and more accurate than  standard schemes such as Cross-Validation.",
