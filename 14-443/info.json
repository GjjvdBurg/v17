    "abstract": "The goal of subspace learning is to find a $k$-dimensional subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^d$, such that the expected squared distance between instance vectors and the subspace is as small as possible. In this paper we study subspace learning in a <i>partial information</i> setting, in which the learner can only observe $r \\le d$ attributes from each instance vector. We propose several efficient algorithms for this task, and analyze their sample complexity.",
