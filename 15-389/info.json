    "abstract": "This work establishes a new upper bound on the number of samples sufficient for PAC learning in the realizable case. The bound matches known lower bounds up to numerical constant factors. This solves a long-standing open problem on the sample complexity of PAC learning. The technique and analysis build on a recent breakthrough by Hans Simon.",
